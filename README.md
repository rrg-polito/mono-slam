# Mono-Slam Implementation in ROS

This repository implements the mono-slam algorithm first introduced by [Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/Publications/davison_etal_pami2007.pdf),
and is the final outcome of the M.Sc. Thesis of [Ludovico O. Russo](https://github.com/ludusrusso)
in the 2013.

*Notes:*
- for some of the jacobian calculation there's a Jupyter notebook explain the result with the use of **Sympy** , to confirm the resulting formula, [here](https://github.com/engyasin/mono-slam/blob/master/reference/Sympy_monoslam_jacobians_1.ipynb)

- Tested with Ros-Kinetic 
## Usage:

```bash
$ rosrun mono-slam mono-slam configuration.cfg /image:=/your_image_topic
```

> configuration file contains parameters for the mono-slam algorithm
  and camera calibration.
  Sample configuration files are provided in the "conf" folder
